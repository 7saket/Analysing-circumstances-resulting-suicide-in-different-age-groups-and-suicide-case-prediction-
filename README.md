# Data science project analyzing various circumstances leading to suicide in males and females across different age groups. 

In this project I have analyzed numerous factors after gathering dataset from Kaggle and implemented various machine learning algorithms to observe, compare and find corresponding circumstances leading to suicide. The resultant models have then been used to do suicide case estimation on the testing datset. All the observations involving various patterns and circumstances are depicted in this repository.
